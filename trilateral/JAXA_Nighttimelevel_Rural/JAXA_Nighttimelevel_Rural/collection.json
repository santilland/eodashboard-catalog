  "description": "# NTLR JAXA Nighttime Light Rural\nThis dataset, NTLR (Nighttime Light Rural), provides a comprehensive \nglobal spatial representation of nighttime light levels in **rural areas**. \nIt is derived from satellite observations from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/viirs) \nsensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. \nThis dataset is valuable for studying the distribution of artificial lighting in rural regions, offering insights into human activity, infrastructure development, and rural electrification. The dataset uses varying shades of color to represent different intensities of light; darker shades indicate areas with less artificial light (e.g., rural or undeveloped regions), while lighter shades of yellow signify regions with higher concentrations of light (e.g., cities and industrial zones).\n\n\n## Dataset description\n- The dataset covers rural areas globally, highlighting nighttime light levels to analyze rural development, access to electricity, and socio-economic activities.\n- Metric: Nighttime radiance values (measured in nanowatts per square centimeter per steradian, nW/cm\u00b2/sr), which represent the brightness of artificial lighting in rural areas. From this can be generated  \nthe Nighttime Light Intensity (NTLI), a composite observations reflecting the overall intensity of visible nighttime lights in rural landscapes.\n- Temporal coverage includes multi-year data, enabling trend analysis in rural electrification, infrastructure changes, and energy use patterns over time.\n\nThe dataset was developed by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) to support global research on rural development, infrastructure expansion, and socio-economic impacts in less urbanized areas. The data from VIIRS, onboard the Suomi NPP satellite, provides consistent, high-quality nighttime light data for rural regions worldwide.\n\nThe dataset is often referenced in scientific and public health research. For example, Bunpei Tojo (2021) used Nightlights data in the study \"Application of Earth observation satellite data to public health: Comparison of night light (VIIRS) and solar radiation (SGLI) and domestic COVID-19 epidemic,\" presented at the 12th Federation of Science and Technology conference, to analyze the relationship between nighttime light intensity and public health factors. \nCitation: Bunpei Tojo, \"Application of earth observation satellite data to public health: Comparison of night light (VIIRS) and solar radiation (SGLI) and domestic COVID-19 epidemic,\" Transdisciplinary 12th Federation of Science and Technology conference 2021, https://doi.org/10.11487/oukan.2021.0_B-4-4.\n",
