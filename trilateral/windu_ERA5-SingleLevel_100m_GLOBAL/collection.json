  "description": "## Wind U Field at 100m  \n\nERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades. Data is available from 1940 onwards. \nERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and\nconsistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction\ncentres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to \nproduce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis \nworks in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have \nthe constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the \ningestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nThis indicator aims at showing the eastward component of the 100 m wind at global level for the year 2023. It is the horizontal speed of air \nmoving towards the east, at a height of 100 metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second [m s-1]. \n \n**Note**\nCare should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point \nin space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box. This parameter can be combined with the northward \ncomponent to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 100 m wind.\n",
